# QuotaVPN - notes for coding agents

The long-form handoff (system map, flows, code map, build and release, traps) is in
`notes/HANDOFF.md`. Read it before changing anything structural.

A VPN client for Windows and Android that routes per-app and per-quota traffic
through a personal Xray/VLESS server. Both apps carry all three transports:
Standard (VLESS), WireGuard (UDP/53) and Hysteria2 (UDP/443). WE's DPI drops plain
WireGuard handshakes from Egypt, so the desktop's WireGuard is AmneziaWG (obfuscated
WireGuard on a forked engine) and connects from there; Hysteria2 is the other
Egypt-proof UDP transport. The phone still runs stock libbox and cannot speak AWG.

## Layout

- `src/` - core Rust: `vpn.rs` (routing rules, per-app policy, WireGuard/Hysteria helpers),
  `server.rs` (server-side provisioning helpers), protocol code shared by both apps.
- `desktop/src-tauri/` - the Windows app: Tauri 2 backend, commands in `src/lib.rs`
  (tray, single instance, signed updater, `tunnel_*`, `generate_card`, `import_card`, `revoke_card`).
- `desktop/ui-next/` - the Windows UI. React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind v4 +
  shadcn/ui + Motion + Lucide. This is the shipping UI.
- `desktop/ui/` - the old vanilla UI, kept only as a reference for behaviours the user liked.
- `android/tauri-app/` - Tauri 2 Android app, Kotlin `VpnService`, phone UI in `ui/`
  (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, not React).
- `android/tauri-plugin-qctunnel/` - the native tunnel plugin, ships `libs/libbox.aar` (27 MB, prebuilt, do not delete).
- `tools/` - `make-icons.py` (all icon sets, desktop + android), `build-apk.sh`, `sync-mobile-assets.sh`.
- `docs/` - `STATUS.md` tracks the current state; read it first.

## Build and verify

Windows, run from git-bash. The toolchain this project was developed against:
`C:/Tools/mingw_extract/mingw64/bin` (MinGW), Android SDK + NDK 28.2.13676358,
`JAVA_HOME` at a JDK 23, Node 22, `tauri-cli` 2.11.4.

- UI: `cd desktop/ui-next && npm install && npm run build`. Run this before any
  installer build: `beforeBuildCommand` is empty, so `tauri build` embeds whatever
  `ui-next/dist` currently holds.
- Desktop app: `cd desktop/src-tauri && cargo build --release --offline --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
  The dev profile does not link under MinGW (`export ordinal too large`), so always
  verify through a release build. Copy `WebView2Loader.dll` next to the exe to run it.
- Installer: from `desktop/`, `node ../android/tauri-cli-npm/node_modules/@tauri-apps/cli/tauri.js build --bundles nsis --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
  with `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` and `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` set and NSIS on PATH.
  Produces `bundle/nsis/QuotaVPN_<version>_x64-setup.exe` plus its `.sig`.
- Phone: `bash tools/build-apk.sh` (needs `ANDROID_HOME`, and `cygpath` before any native SDK `.exe`).
- Icons: `python tools/make-icons.py`. It trims the master to its content box and verifies every frame;
  run it after touching `res/app-icon-src.png` only.

## Conventions that matter

- **React stack is mandatory for the desktop UI.** Before adding a component, check shadcn/ui;
  before hand-rolling an animation, check Motion. Do not add another UI library.
- **No dropdown menus.** Choices use the searchable list picker (`components/PickerDialog.tsx`)
  with a check on the current value.
- **Theme**: luminous night scene behind everything, every surface a frosted glass pane
  (`index.css` tokens, `.scene`, `.glass*`). Keep `backdrop-filter` free of the `-webkit-` twin:
  Vite's minifier keeps only that one and Chromium then ignores it, killing the blur.
- **All user-visible strings go through `src/lib/i18n/{en,ar}.ts`** (formal Modern Standard Arabic,
  RTL). Never mirror the layout in Arabic, only the text direction.
- **Never emit em-dashes** in code, UI strings, or docs. Plain hyphens only. The user treats
  anything else as an obvious tell.
- **Version lives in four files**: `desktop/src-tauri/{tauri.conf.json,Cargo.toml}` and
  `android/tauri-app/src-tauri/{tauri.conf.json,Cargo.toml}`. Bump all four together.
- **Releases**: bump, build the installer and the APK, then publish the GitHub release with the
  updater feed. The feed asset must be named exactly `latest.json`; the app reads
  `releases/latest/download/latest.json`. Ship both platforms at the same version. The feed also
  carries a `build` stamp (short git hash, written by the publish scripts) so a re-release under
  the same version number still reaches installed apps; commit the bump before creating the
  release (the tag follows the remote default branch). Confirm the stamp landed: the short hash
  must appear in the built `release/QuotaVPN.exe` (the setup exe is compressed). A stale
  stamp makes every install re-offer the same release.
- **Secrets** (keystore, updater key and passwords, the server private key in
  `%APPDATA%/quotacards/config.json`) never enter the repo and never get printed.
- **Commit author for this repository is `YousefMohiey`.** Do not add agent or assistant
  attribution to commits, code comments, or docs.

## Verifying UI work

Run the built UI with `npm run preview` (port 4173) and drive it over CDP. Two traps:
the harness throttles timers in pages it considers background, so enable
`Emulation.setFocusEmulationEnabled` before timing anything, and the animation clock can be
frozen, so measure geometry numerically rather than trusting a screenshot.

## Current state

v0.3.2 is the latest release (installer, APK, `latest.json`): the installer now leaves exactly
one desktop shortcut, named QuotaVPN, removing leftovers from older installs everywhere
(user and shared desktops, both start menus) on install and update, and the finish page no
longer asks about creating a shortcut. The app is unchanged from 0.3.1 (AmneziaWG WireGuard,
disconnect fix, live speed test, stripped binary). Windows UI is the React app in
`desktop/ui-next`; the phone still runs the vanilla UI. `notes/STATUS.md` has the details.
